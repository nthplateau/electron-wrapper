# electron-wrapper-template

This is a simple [Electron](https://electronjs.org) wrapper app, used by the [Twine App Builder](https://github.com/lazerwalker/twine-app-builder) project to help game developers bundle up their HTML5 games as desktop applications.

The primary usecase for modifying this repo is if you want to fork it to add additional OS-level functionality to your game binary. Check out the [Twine App Builder](https://github.com/lazerwalker/twine-app-builder) for more info.

This project was generated using [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/) and is only lightly modified from the default (some sensible defaults to `forge.config.js` and some minor tweaks to the only JS file). Electron Forge documentation is the first place you should look for info about configuration options or the build pipeline for making changes.
